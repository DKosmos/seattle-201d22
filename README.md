Welcome to Code 201! This is a class that builds on your foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of any Code 301 class.

# Introduction

The general course schedule is:

Session  | Topic

## Lecture Notes & Class Demos

Lecture Notes will be placed in each class' lecture-code subdirectory after they are presented.  

Any accompanying code demos will also be placed into each class' `code-demos` directory as they are written.

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. You can find these assignments in the subdirectories of each class folder. Assignment content will very from day to day, depending on the topic. Some of the lab assignments will be pair programming assignments.

Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in the README files of the appropriate subdirectories.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step by step help as needed.

OK, let's get to it!
